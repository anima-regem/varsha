				Our life is a story of pain as well as joy. It is a mingled yarn, good and ill together. Out of the
				shadows of pain, goodness often comes out. Even then a happy life means a life of freedom from the petty
				cares and worry of getting the daily bread. To be happy I should have enough to support myself, without
				being hampered by poverty or authority or influence. I do not mean that I should have untold wealth.
				This will cause trouble. But I should have just enough of the good things of life to keep my sense of
				independence. </p>
